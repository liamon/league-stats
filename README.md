# league-stats
This was an assignment in the Object-Oriented Programming module in Second Year.
It was intended to get us practising unit testing with JUnit.

## Original Instructions
>### Description:
>- The LeagueStatistics class contains a reference to a single League object.
>- A League object is composed of Division objects.
>- A Division is composed of Team objects
>- A Team can be part of only one Division and is made up of multiple Players objects.
>- A player can only be part of one Team.
>- The LeagueStatistics class provides various query operations: GetNumDivisions(), getNumTeams(), getNumGoalsForDivision(name), getNumGoalsForTeam(name), getAveAgeOfTeam(name)
>
>### What you have to do:
>1. Create a unit test for each of the operations of the LeagueStatisticss class. To start with, keep it simple : your test should have 2 Divisions, with 2 teams each, each team has 3 players. That is enough to test the first version of your code.
>2. Then spend a few minutes thinking and write down the the classes you will need and the methods. For example, if you are going to have a Team class, what method(s) will it need to allow your LeagueStats class to return getNumGoalsForTeam(name);
>3. Then, starting with your first unit test. Implement the classes and methods to make this first test run correctly. 
>4. Once your first unit test is passing, implement the extra code that is require to pass your second unit test, then your third, your fourth and so on. In this way, your tests will drive your development.
